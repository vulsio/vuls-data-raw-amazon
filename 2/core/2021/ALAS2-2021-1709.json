	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-30547:\n\tOut of bounds write in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.101 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.\n1970109: CVE-2021-30547 chromium-browser: Out of bounds write in ANGLE\n\nCVE-2021-29989:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR 78.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992423: CVE-2021-29989 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.13\n\nCVE-2021-29988:\n\tFirefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992419: CVE-2021-29988 Mozilla: Memory corruption as a result of incorrect style treatment\n\nCVE-2021-29986:\n\tA suspected race condition when calling getaddrinfo led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: This issue only affected Linux operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992417: CVE-2021-29986 Mozilla: Race condition when resolving DNS names could have led to memory corruption\n\nCVE-2021-29985:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in media channels could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992422: CVE-2021-29985 Mozilla: Use-after-free media channels\n\nCVE-2021-29984:\n\tInstruction reordering resulted in a sequence of instructions that would cause an object to be incorrectly considered during garbage collection. This led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992420: CVE-2021-29984 Mozilla: Incorrect instruction reordering during JIT optimization\n\nCVE-2021-29980:\n\tUninitialized memory in a canvas object could have caused an incorrect free() leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.\n1992421: CVE-2021-29980 Mozilla: Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have led to memory corruption\n\nCVE-2021-29976:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox and Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and Firefox < 90.\n1982014: CVE-2021-29976 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR 78.12\n\nCVE-2021-29970:\n\tA malicious webpage could have triggered a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. *This bug could only be triggered when accessibility was enabled.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and Firefox < 90.\n1982013: CVE-2021-29970 Mozilla: Use-after-free in accessibility features of a document\n\nCVE-2021-29969:\n\tIf Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and an attacker injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake, then Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted in Thunderbird showing incorrect information, for example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to show folders that didn't exist on the IMAP server. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12.\n1982015: CVE-2021-29969 Mozilla: IMAP server responses sent by a MITM prior to STARTTLS could be processed\n",
