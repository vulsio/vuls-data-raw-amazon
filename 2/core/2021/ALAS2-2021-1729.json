The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997786: CVE-2021-39150 xstream: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) via unsafe deserialization of com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.sei.*\n\nCVE-2021-39149:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997784: CVE-2021-39149 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of com.sun.corba.*\n\nCVE-2021-39148:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again.

This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997779: CVE-2021-39147 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapSearchEnumeration\n\nCVE-2021-39146:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997777: CVE-2021-39146 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of javax.swing.UIDefaults$ProxyLazyValue\n\nCVE-2021-39145:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997775: CVE-2021-39145 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapBindingEnumeration\n\nCVE-2021-39144:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997772: CVE-2021-39144 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of sun.tracing.*\n\nCVE-2021-39141:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997769: CVE-2021-39141 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.sei.*\n\nCVE-2021-39140:\n\tXStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n1997765: CVE-2021-39140 xstream: Infinite loop DoS via unsafe deserialization of sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler\n\nCVE-2021-39139:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1997763: CVE-2021-39139 xstream: Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization of Xalan xsltc.trax.TemplatesImpl\n",
