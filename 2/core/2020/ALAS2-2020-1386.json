  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-17012:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n1779437: CVE-2019-17012 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 71 and Firefox ESR 68.3\n\nCVE-2019-17011:\n\tUnder certain conditions, when retrieving a document from a DocShell in the antitracking code, a race condition could cause a use-after-free condition and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n1779436: CVE-2019-17011 Mozilla: Use-after-free when retrieving a document in antitracking\n\nCVE-2019-17010:\n\tUnder certain conditions, when checking the Resist Fingerprinting preference during device orientation checks, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n1779434: CVE-2019-17010 Mozilla: Use-after-free when performing device orientation checks\n\nCVE-2019-17008:\n\tWhen using nested workers, a use-after-free could occur during worker destruction. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n1779431: CVE-2019-17008 Mozilla: Use-after-free in worker destruction\n\nCVE-2019-17005:\n\tThe plain text serializer used a fixed-size array for the number of <ol> elements it could process; however it was possible to overflow the static-sized array leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n1779435: CVE-2019-17005 Mozilla: Buffer overflow in plain text serializer\n",
