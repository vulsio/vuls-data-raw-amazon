  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-17026:\n\tNeeded\n1789214: CVE-2019-17026 Mozilla: IonMonkey type confusion with StoreElementHole and FallibleStoreElement\n\nCVE-2019-17024:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 71 and Firefox ESR 68.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.\n1788727: CVE-2019-17024 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4\n\nCVE-2019-17022:\n\tWhen pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior, more may exist. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.\n1788726: CVE-2019-17022 Mozilla: CSS sanitization does not escape HTML tags\n\nCVE-2019-17017:\n\tDue to a missing case handling object types, a type confusion vulnerability could occur, resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.\n1788724: CVE-2019-17017 Mozilla: Type Confusion in XPCVariant.cpp\n\nCVE-2019-17016:\n\tWhen pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.\n1788723: CVE-2019-17016 Mozilla: Bypass of @namespace CSS sanitization during pasting\n",
