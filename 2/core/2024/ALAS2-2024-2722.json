	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-9143:\n\tIssue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted\nexplicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads\nor writes.\n\nImpact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or\neven a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols\ninvolving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named\ncurves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they\nspecify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent\nproblematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable\napplication is low.\n\nIn particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,\nso problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509\ncertificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\"\ncurve encoding.\n\nThe affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.\n\nApplications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,\nthat make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero\nconstant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a\nresult of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution\ncannot easily be ruled out.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nCVE-2024-38796:\n\tEDK2 contains a vulnerability in the PeCoffLoaderRelocateImage(). An Attacker may cause memory corruption due to an overflow via an adjacent network. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and/or Availability.\n\nCVE-2023-45237:\n\tEDK2's Network Package is susceptible to a predictable TCP Initial Sequence Number. This\n vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2023-45236:\n\tEDK2's Network Package is susceptible to a predictable TCP Initial Sequence Number. This\n vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2021-38578:\n\tExisting CommBuffer checks in SmmEntryPoint will not catch underflow when computing BufferSize.\n\nCVE-2021-38576:\n\tA BIOS bug in firmware for a particular PC model leaves the Platform authorization value empty. This can be used to permanently brick the TPM in multiple ways, as well as to non-permanently DoS the system.\n\nCVE-2021-28216:\n\tBootPerformanceTable pointer is read from an NVRAM variable in PEI. Recommend setting PcdFirmwarePerformanceDataTableS3Support to FALSE.\n\nCVE-2021-28211:\n\tA heap overflow in LzmaUefiDecompressGetInfo function in EDK II.\n",
