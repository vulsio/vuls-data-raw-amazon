	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-32215:\n\tMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 112 and Firefox ESR 102.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2023-32213:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen reading a file, an uninitialized value could have been used as read limit.\n\nCVE-2023-32212:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nAn attacker could have positioned a `datalist` element to obscure the address bar.\n\nCVE-2023-32211:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nA type checking bug would have led to invalid code being compiled.\n\nCVE-2023-32207:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nA missing delay in popup notifications could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permissions.\n\nCVE-2023-32206:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nAn out-of-bound read could have led to a crash in the RLBox Expat driver.\n\nCVE-2023-32205:\n\tIn multiple cases browser prompts could have been obscured by popups controlled by content. These could have led to potential user confusion and spoofing attacks.\n",
