	},
	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-3978:\n\tText nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be. This could lead to an XSS attack.\n\nCVE-2023-29409:\n\tExtremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to <= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.\n\nCVE-2023-29406:\n\tThe HTTP/1 client does not fully validate the contents of the Host header. A maliciously crafted Host header can inject additional headers or entire requests. With fix, the HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.\n\nCVE-2023-24540:\n\thtml/template: improper handling of JavaScript whitespace.\n\nNot all valid JavaScript whitespace characters were considered to be whitespace. Templates containing whitespace characters outside of the character set \"\\t\\n\\f\\r\\u0020\\u2028\\u2029\" in JavaScript contexts that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized during execution.\n\nCVE-2023-24538:\n\tTemplates did not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and as such did\nnot escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template\ncontained a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action could\nbe used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template.\n\nCVE-2022-41723:\n\thttp2/hpack: avoid quadratic complexity in hpack decoding\n\nCVE-2021-43565:\n\tThe x/crypto/ssh package before 0.0.0-20211202192323-5770296d904e of golang.org/x/crypto allows an attacker to panic an SSH server.\n",
