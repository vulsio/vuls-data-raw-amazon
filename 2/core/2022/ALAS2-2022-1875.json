	"Title": "Amazon Linux 2 2017.12 - ALAS2-2022-1875: medium priority package update for curl",
	"Issued": {
		"Date": "2022-10-31 19:40:00"
	},
	"Updated": {
		"Date": "2022-11-08 22:20:00"
	},
	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-35252:\n\tA vulnerability found in curl. This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n",
