	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-4104:\n\tA flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in version 1.x . This allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the deployed application is configured to use JMSAppender. This flaw has been filed for Log4j 1.x, the corresponding flaw information for Log4j 2.x is available at: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-44228\n\nCVE-2019-17571:\n\tA flaw was discovered in Log4j, where a vulnerable SocketServer class may lead to the deserialization of untrusted data. This flaw allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget.\n\nCVE-2017-5645:\n\tIt was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application.\n",
