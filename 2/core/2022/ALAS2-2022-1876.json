	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-48659:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slub: fix to return errno if kmalloc() fails\n\nCVE-2022-48651:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb->mac_header If an AF_PACKET socket is used to send packets through ipvlan and the default xmit function of the AF_PACKET socket is changed from dev_queue_xmit() to packet_direct_xmit() via setsockopt() with the option name of PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, the skb->mac_header may not be reset and remains as the initial value of 65535, this may trigger slab-out-of-bounds bugs as following:\n\nCVE-2022-48641:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ebtables: fix memory leak when blob is malformed\n\nCVE-2022-43750:\n\tdrivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.\n\nCVE-2022-41850:\n\troccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report->value is in progress.\n\nCVE-2022-41849:\n\tdrivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-40768:\n\tdrivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.\n\nCVE-2022-39842:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur.\n\nCVE-2022-3649:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992.\n\nCVE-2022-3646:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3621:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920.\n\nCVE-2022-3594:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to logging of excessive data. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211363.\n\nCVE-2022-3565:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211088.\n\nCVE-2022-3542:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel. This vulnerability affects the function bnx2x_tpa_stop of the file drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_cmn.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211042 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-2978:\n\tA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel NILFS file system was found in the way user triggers function security_inode_alloc to fail with following call to function nilfs_mdt_destroy. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-47103:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninet: fully convert sk->sk_rx_dst to RCU rules\n",
