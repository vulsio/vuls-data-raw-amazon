	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-2678:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JNDI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit: R28.3.16. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n1534263: \nCVE-2018-2678 OpenJDK: unbounded memory allocation in BasicAttributes deserialization (JNDI, 8191142)\n\nCVE-2018-2677:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n1534288: \nCVE-2018-2677 OpenJDK: unbounded memory allocation during deserialization (AWT, 8190289)\n\nCVE-2018-2663:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit: R28.3.16.

Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.

A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended deserialization restrictions.\n1534970: \nCVE-2018-2637 OpenJDK: SingleEntryRegistry incorrect setup of deserialization filter (JMX, 8186998)\n\nCVE-2018-2634:\n\tThe JGSS component of OpenJDK ignores the value of the javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly property when using HTTP/SPNEGO authentication and always uses global credentials. It was discovered that this could cause global credentials to be unexpectedly used by an untrusted Java application.\n1534943: \nCVE-2018-2634 OpenJDK: use of global credentials for HTTP/SPNEGO (JGSS, 8186600)\n\nCVE-2018-2633:\n\tIt was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the JNDI component of OpenJDK failed to securely handle LDAP referrals. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to make it fetch attacker controlled certificate data.\n1535036: \nCVE-2018-2633 OpenJDK: LDAPCertStore insecure handling of LDAP referrals (JNDI, 8186606)\n\nCVE-2018-2629:\n\tIt was discovered that the JGSS component of OpenJDK failed to properly handle GSS context in the native GSS library wrapper in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly make a Java application using JGSS to use a previously freed context.\n1534625: \nCVE-2018-2629 OpenJDK: GSS context use-after-free (JGSS, 8186212)\n\nCVE-2018-2618:\n\tIt was discovered that the key agreement implementations in the JCE component of OpenJDK did not guarantee sufficient strength of used keys to adequately protect generated shared secret. This could make it easier to break data encryption by attacking key agreement rather than the encryption using the negotiated secret.\n1534762: \nCVE-2018-2618 OpenJDK: insufficient strength of key agreement (JCE, 8185292)\n\nCVE-2018-2603:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK failed to sufficiently limit the amount of memory allocated when reading DER encoded input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application use an excessive amount of memory if it parsed attacker supplied DER encoded input.\n1534553: \nCVE-2018-2603 OpenJDK: DerValue unbounded memory allocation (Libraries, 8182387)\n\nCVE-2018-2602:\n\tIt was discovered that the I18n component of OpenJDK could use an untrusted search path when loading resource bundle classes. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as another local user by making their Java application load an attacker controlled class file.\n1534525: \nCVE-2018-2602 OpenJDK: loading of classes from untrusted locations (I18n, 8182601)\n\nCVE-2018-2599:\n\tIt was discovered that the DNS client implementation in the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not use random source ports when sending out DNS queries. This could make it easier for a remote attacker to spoof responses to those queries.\n1534543: \nCVE-2018-2599 OpenJDK: DnsClient missing source port randomization (JNDI, 8182125)\n\nCVE-2018-2588:\n\tIt was discovered that the LDAP component of OpenJDK failed to properly encode special characters in user names when adding them to an LDAP search query. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to manipulate LDAP queries performed by the LdapLoginModule class.\n1534299: \nCVE-2018-2588 OpenJDK: LdapLoginModule insufficient username encoding in LDAP query (LDAP, 8178449)\n\nCVE-2018-2582:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.

This could possibly cause a multi-threaded Java application to apply weak encryption to data because of the use of a key that was zeroed out.\n1534298: \nCVE-2018-2579 OpenJDK: unsynchronized access to encryption key data (Libraries, 8172525)\n",
