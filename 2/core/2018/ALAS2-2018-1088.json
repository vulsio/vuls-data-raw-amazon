  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-16802:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.25. Incorrect &quot;restoration of privilege&quot; checking when running out of stack during exception handling could be used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the &quot;pipe&quot; instruction. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.\n1627959: \nCVE-2018-16802 ghostscript: Incorrect \"restoration of privilege\" checking when running out of stack during exception handling\n\nCVE-2018-16585:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. The .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use during document processing (e.g., after the startup phase). This leads to memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.\n1626193: \nCVE-2018-16585 ghostscript: .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use\n\nCVE-2018-16542:\n\tIt was discovered that ghostscript did not properly handle certain stack overflow error conditions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1621363: \nCVE-2018-16542 ghostscript: .definemodifiedfont memory corruption if /typecheck is handled (699668)\n\nCVE-2018-16541:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript device cleanup did not properly handle devices replaced with a null device. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1625846: \nCVE-2018-16541 ghostscript: incorrect free logic in pagedevice replacement (699664)\n\nCVE-2018-16540:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript PDF14 compositor did not properly handle the copying of a device. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1625843: \nCVE-2018-16540 ghostscript: use-after-free in copydevice handling (699661)\n\nCVE-2018-16539:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript did not properly restrict access to files open prior to enabling the -dSAFER mode. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and disclose the content of affected files via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1625839: \nCVE-2018-16539 ghostscript: incorrect access checking in temp file handling to disclose contents of files (699658)\n\nCVE-2018-16513:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript did not properly validate the operands passed to the setcolor function. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1619750: \nCVE-2018-16513 ghostscript: setcolor missing type check (699655)\n\nCVE-2018-16511:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. A type confusion in &quot;ztype&quot; could be used by remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.\n1621359: \nCVE-2018-16511 ghostscript: missing type check in type checker (699659)\n\nCVE-2018-16509:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript /invalidaccess checks fail under certain conditions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and, for example, execute arbitrary shell commands via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1619748: \nCVE-2018-16509 ghostscript: /invalidaccess bypass after failed restore (699654)\n\nCVE-2018-15911:\n\tIt was discovered that ghostscript did not properly verify the key used in aesdecode. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1625832: \nCVE-2018-15911 ghostscript: uninitialized memory access in the aesdecode operator (699665)\n\nCVE-2018-15910:\n\tIt was discovered that the type of the LockDistillerParams parameter is not properly verified. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1619751: \nCVE-2018-15910 ghostscript: LockDistillerParams type confusion (699656)\n\nCVE-2018-15909:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript .shfill operator did not properly validate certain types. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1621361: \nCVE-2018-15909 ghostscript: shading_param incomplete type checking (699660)\n\nCVE-2018-15908:\n\tIt was discovered that the ghostscript .tempfile function did not properly handle file permissions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and delete files or disclose their content via a specially crafted PostScript document.\n1619756: \nCVE-2018-15908 ghostscript: .tempfile file permission issues (699657)\n\nCVE-2018-11645:\n\tGhostscript did not honor the -dSAFER option when executing the &quot;status&quot; instruction, which can be used to retrieve information such as a file&#039;s existence and size. A specially crafted postscript document could use this flow to gain information on the targeted system&#039;s filesystem content.\n1585914: \nCVE-2018-11645 ghostscript: status command permitted with -dSAFER in psi/zfile.c allowing attackers to identify the size and existence of files\n",
