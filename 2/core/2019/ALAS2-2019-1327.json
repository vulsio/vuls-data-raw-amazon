	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-8905:\n\tIn LibTIFF 4.0.9, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the function LZWDecodeCompat in tif_lzw.c via a crafted TIFF file, as demonstrated by tiff2ps.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-8905 libtiff: heap-based buffer overflow in tif_lzw.c:LZWDecodeCompat() allows for denial of service\n\nCVE-2018-7456:\n\tA NULL Pointer Dereference occurs in the function TIFFPrintDirectory in tif_print.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 when using the tiffinfo tool to print crafted TIFF information, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-18013. (This affects an earlier part of the TIFFPrintDirectory function that was not addressed by the CVE-2017-18013 patch.)\n99999: \nCVE-2018-7456 libtiff: NULL pointer dereference in tif_print.c:TIFFPrintDirectory() causes a denial of service\n\nCVE-2018-18661:\n\tAn issue was discovered in LibTIFF 4.0.9. There is a NULL pointer dereference in the function LZWDecode in the file tif_lzw.c.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-18661 libtiff: tiff2bw tool failed memory allocation leads to crash\n\nCVE-2018-18557:\n\tLibTIFF 4.0.9 (with JBIG enabled) decodes arbitrarily-sized JBIG into a buffer, ignoring the buffer size, which leads to a tif_jbig.c JBIGDecode out-of-bounds write.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-18557 libtiff: Out-of-bounds write in tif_jbig.c\n\nCVE-2018-17101:\n\tAn issue was discovered in LibTIFF 4.0.9. There are two out-of-bounds writes in cpTags in tools/tiff2bw.c and tools/pal2rgb.c, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-17101 libtiff: Two out-of-bounds writes in cpTags in tools/tiff2bw.c and tools/pal2rgb.c\n\nCVE-2018-17100:\n\tAn issue was discovered in LibTIFF 4.0.9. There is a int32 overflow in multiply_ms in tools/ppm2tiff.c, which can cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-17100 libtiff: Integer overflow in multiply_ms in tools/ppm2tiff.c\n\nCVE-2018-12900:\n\tHeap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function in tiffcp.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-12900 libtiff: Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function resulting in a denial of service or possibly code execution\n\nCVE-2018-10963:\n\tThe TIFFWriteDirectorySec() function in tif_dirwrite.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application crash) via a crafted file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-13726.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-10963 libtiff: reachable assertion in TIFFWriteDirectorySec function in tif_dirwrite.c\n\nCVE-2018-10779:\n\tAn integer overflow has been discovered in libtiff in TIFFSetupStrips:tif_write.c, which could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in TIFFWriteScanline:tif_write.c. An attacker may use this vulnerability to corrupt memory or cause Denial of Service.\n99999: \nCVE-2018-10779 libtiff: heap-based buffer over-read in TIFFWriteScanline function in tif_write.c\n\nCVE-2016-3186:\n\tBuffer overflow in the readextension function in gif2tiff.c in LibTIFF 4.0.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted GIF file.\n99999: \nCVE-2016-3186 libtiff: buffer overflow in gif2tiff\n",
