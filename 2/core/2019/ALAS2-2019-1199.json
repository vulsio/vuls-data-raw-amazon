	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-3863:\n\tA flaw was found in libssh2 before 1.8.1. A server could send a multiple keyboard interactive response messages whose total length are greater than unsigned char max characters. This value is used as an index to copy memory causing in an out of bounds memory write error.\n1687313: \nCVE-2019-3863 libssh2: Integer overflow in user authenticate keyboard interactive allows out-of-bounds writes\n\nCVE-2019-3857:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets with an exit signal are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n1687305: \nCVE-2019-3857 libssh2: Integer overflow in SSH packet processing channel resulting in out of bounds write\n\nCVE-2019-3856:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw, which could lead to an out of bounds write, was discovered in libssh2 in the way keyboard prompt requests are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n1687304: \nCVE-2019-3856 libssh2: Integer overflow in keyboard interactive handling resulting in out of bounds write\n\nCVE-2019-3855:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n1687303: \nCVE-2019-3855 libssh2: Integer overflow in transport read resulting in out of bounds write\n",
