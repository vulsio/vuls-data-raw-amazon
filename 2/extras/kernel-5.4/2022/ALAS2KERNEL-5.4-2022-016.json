  },
  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.4 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-20565:\n\tAn issue in the HID driver in the Linux kernel may lead to invalid memory access.\n\nCVE-2020-25641:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-25285:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernels sysctl handling code for hugepages management. When multiple root level processes would write to modify the /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file it could create a race on internal variables leading to a system crash or memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2020-25284:\n\tA flaw was found in the capabilities check of the rados block device functionality in the Linux kernel. Incorrect capability checks could alllow a local user with root priviledges (but no capabilities) to add or remove Rados Block Devices from the system.\n\nCVE-2020-25212:\n\tA flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation where when mounting a remote attacker controlled server it could return specially crafted response allow for local memory corruption and possibly privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2020-14390:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When changing screen size, an out-of-bounds memory write can occur leading to memory corruption or a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.\n\nCVE-2020-14385:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A failure of the file system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt.  This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-14314:\n\tA memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-12888:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where it allows userspace processes, for example, a guest VM, to directly access h/w devices via its VFIO driver modules. The VFIO modules allow users to enable or disable access to the devices' MMIO memory address spaces. If a user attempts to access the read/write devices' MMIO address space when it is disabled, some h/w devices issue an interrupt to the CPU to indicate a fatal error condition, crashing the system. This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the host system resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2019-19770:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the debugfs_remove function in the Linux kernel. The flaw could allow a local attacker with special user (or root) privilege to crash the system at the time of file or directory removal. This vulnerability can lead to a kernel information leak. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2019-19448:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of BTRFS free space management, where the kernel does not correctly manage the lifetime of internal data structures used. An attacker could use this flaw to corrupt memory or escalate privileges.\n",
