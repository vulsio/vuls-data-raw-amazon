	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Livepatch that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-23849:\n\tIn rds_recv_track_latency in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is an off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access.\n\nCVE-2024-0646:\n\tAn out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Transport Layer Security functionality in how a user calls a function splice with a ktls socket as the destination. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2024-0565:\n\tAn out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in receive_encrypted_standard in fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c in the SMB Client sub-component in the Linux Kernel. This issue occurs due to integer underflow on the memcpy length, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-6932:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ipv4: igmp component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nA race condition can be exploited to cause a timer be mistakenly registered on a RCU read locked object which is freed by another thread.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit e2b706c691905fe78468c361aaabc719d0a496f1.\n\nCVE-2023-6817:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe function nft_pipapo_walk did not skip inactive elements during set walk which could lead double deactivations of PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a.\n\nCVE-2023-6606:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smbCalcSize in fs/smb/client/netmisc.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2023-6040:\n\tAn out-of-bounds access vulnerability involving netfilter was reported and fixed as: f1082dd31fe4 (netfilter: nf_tables: Reject tables of unsupported family); While creating a new netfilter table, lack of a safeguard against invalid nf_tables family (pf) values within `nf_tables_newtable` function enables an attacker to achieve out-of-bounds access.\n",
