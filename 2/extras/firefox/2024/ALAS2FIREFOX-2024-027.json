	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Firefox that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-6604:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 127, Firefox ESR 115.12, and Thunderbird 115.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 128 and Firefox ESR < 115.13.\n\nCVE-2024-6603:\n\tIn an out-of-memory scenario an allocation could fail but free would have been called on the pointer afterwards leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 128 and Firefox ESR < 115.13.\n\nCVE-2024-6602:\n\tA mismatch between allocator and deallocator could have lead to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 128 and Firefox ESR < 115.13.\n\nCVE-2024-6601:\n\tA race condition could lead to a cross-origin container obtaining permissions of the top-level origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 128 and Firefox ESR < 115.13.\n\nCVE-2024-5696:\n\tBy manipulating the text in an `&lt;input&gt;` tag, an attacker could have caused corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 127 and Firefox ESR < 115.12.\n\nCVE-2024-5690:\n\tBy monitoring the time certain operations take, an attacker could have guessed which external protocol handlers were functional on a user's system. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 127, Firefox ESR < 115.12, and Thunderbird < 115.12.\n\nCVE-2023-6349:\n\tA heap overflow vulnerability exists in libvpx - Encoding a frame that has larger dimensions than the originally configured size with VP9 may result in a heap overflow in libvpx.\nWe recommend upgrading to version 1.13.1 or above\n",
