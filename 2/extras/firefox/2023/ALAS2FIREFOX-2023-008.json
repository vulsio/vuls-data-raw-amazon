  "Updated": {
    "Date": "2023-09-25 22:12"
  },
  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Firefox that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-46882:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: A use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-46881:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: An optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-46880:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: A missing check related to tex units could have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-46878:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-46874:\n\tA file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user confusion and the execution of malicious code.<br/>*Note*: This issue was originally included in the advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird) was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 108, Thunderbird < 102.6.1, Thunderbird < 102.6, and Firefox ESR < 102.6.\n\nCVE-2022-46872:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages.\n\n*This bug only affects Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*\n",
