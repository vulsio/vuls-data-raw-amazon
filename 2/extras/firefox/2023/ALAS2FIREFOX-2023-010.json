	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Firefox that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-42932:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of Mozilla developers Ashley Hale and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team, reporting memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105 and Firefox ESR 102.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and, with enough effort, exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-42929:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of a website called window.print() causing a denial of service of the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on the user's session restore settings.\n\nCVE-2022-42928:\n\tMozilla: Certain types of allocations were missing annotations that, if the Garbage Collector was in a specific state, could have lead to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-42927:\n\tMozilla: A same-origin policy violation could have allowed the theft of cross-origin URL entries, leaking the result of a redirect, via performance.getEntries().\n\nCVE-2022-40962:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Jeff Muizelaar, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla Fuzzin\ng Team reporting memory safety bugs present in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and the presumption that with enough effort, some have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-40961:\n\tA stack based buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in Mozilla Firefox and Firefox ESR. This vulnerability occurs when the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function). An attacker could cause of denial-of-service style crash by exploiting this vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker would need to convince a user to visit a specially crafted website or open a malicious document.\n\nCVE-2022-40960:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe, leading to a use-after-free problem and causin\ng a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-40959:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized during iframe navigation, leading to a bypass that leak\ned device permissions into untrusted subdocuments.\n\nCVE-2022-40958:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that by injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain, which is not a secure context,\n could set and overwrite cookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and other attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-40957:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of inconsistent data in the instruction and data cache when creating wasm code, which could lead to a potentially exploitable\n crash.\n\nCVE-2022-40956:\n\tA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that when injecting an HTML base element; some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri settings and accept the injected element's base instead.\n\nCVE-2022-40674:\n\tA vulnerability was found in expat. With this flaw, it is possible to create a situation in which parsing is suspended while substituting in an internal entity so that XML_ResumeParser directly uses the internalEntityProcessor as its processor. If the subsequent parse includes some unclosed tags, this will return without calling storeRawNames to ensure that the raw versions of the tag names are stored in memory other than the parse buffer itself. Issues occur if the parse buffer is changed or reallocated (for example, if processing a file line by line), problems occur. Using this vulnerability in the doContent function allows an attacker to triage a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-28429:\n\tInteger overflow vulnerability in av_timecode_make_string in libavutil/timecode.c in FFmpeg version 4.3.2, allows local attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted .mov file.\n",
