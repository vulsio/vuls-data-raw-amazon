  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Tomcat9 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-28708:\n\tWhen using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a reverse proxy via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto header set to https, session cookies created by Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85 did not include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent transmitting the session cookie over an insecure channel.\n\nCVE-2023-24998:\n\tApache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request parts to be processed resulting in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads. Note that, like all of the file upload limits, the new configuration option (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is not enabled by default and must be explicitly configured.\n\nCVE-2022-45143:\n\tThe JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.\n\nCVE-2020-13935:\n\tA flaw was found in Apache Tomcat, where the payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated. Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2019-17563:\n\tWhen using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2019-12418:\n\tA privilege escalation flaw was found in Tomcat when the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener was enabled. A local attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files could be able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker could then capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.\n",
