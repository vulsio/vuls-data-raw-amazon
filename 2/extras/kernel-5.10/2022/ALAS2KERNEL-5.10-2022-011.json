The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.\n\nCVE-2022-23960:\n\tThe Amazon Linux kernel now enables, by default, a software mitigation for this issue, on all ARM-based EC2 instance types.\n\nCVE-2022-1055:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the tc_new_tfilter function in net/sched/cls_api.c in the Linux kernel. The availability of local, unprivileged user namespaces allows privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2022-0847:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the flags member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0435:\n\tA stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.\n\nCVE-2022-0002:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(r) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\nCVE-2022-0001:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2021-47617:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault\n\nCVE-2021-4197:\n\tAn unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-26401:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n\nCVE-2021-26341:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n",
