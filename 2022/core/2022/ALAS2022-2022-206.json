  "Title": "Amazon Linux 2022 - ALAS2022-2022-206: Medium priority package update for curl",
  "Issued": {
    "Date": "2022-11-01 21:25"
  },
  "Updated": {
    "Date": "2022-12-06 16:47"
  },
  "Severity": "Medium",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2022 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-35252:\n\tA vulnerability found in curl. This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-30115:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when using its HTTP Strict Transport Security(HSTS) support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This flaw leads to a clear text transmission of sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-27782:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because curl can reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH-related option is changed that should have prohibited reuse. This flaw leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27780:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like / when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a different URL using the wrong hostname when it is later retrieved. This flaw allows a malicious actor to make circumventing filters.\n\nCVE-2022-27779:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs because curl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot. This flaw allows arbitrary sites to set cookies that get sent to a different and unrelated site or domain by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27776:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number. Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`headers. Those headers often contain privacy-sensitive information or data.\n\nCVE-2022-27775:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw occurs due to errors in the logic where the config matching function did not take the IPv6 address zone id into account. This issue can lead to curl reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id, and the subsequent transfer uses another.\n\nCVE-2022-27774:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth-protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers.\n\nCVE-2022-22576:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows reusing OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly ensuring that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials set for this transfer. This issue leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n",
