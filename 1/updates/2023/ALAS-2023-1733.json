	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-3467:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Jasper versions before 2.0.26 handled component references in CDEF box in the JP2 image format decoder. A specially crafted JP2 image file could cause an application using the Jasper library to crash when opened.\n\nCVE-2021-3443:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Jasper versions before 2.0.27 handled component references in the JP2 image format decoder. A specially crafted JP2 image file could cause an application using the Jasper library to crash when opened.\n\nCVE-2021-3272:\n\tjp2_decode in jp2/jp2_dec.c in libjasper in JasPer 2.0.24 has a heap-based buffer over-read when there is an invalid relationship between the number of channels and the number of image components.\n\nCVE-2021-26927:\n\tA flaw was found in jasper before 2.0.25. A null pointer dereference in jp2_decode in jp2_dec.c may lead to program crash and denial of service.\n\nCVE-2021-26926:\n\tA flaw was found in jasper before 2.0.25. An out of bounds read issue was found in jp2_decode function whic may lead to disclosure of information or program crash.\n\nCVE-2020-27828:\n\tA flaw was found in the Jasper tool's jpc encoder.
