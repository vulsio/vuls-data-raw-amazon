	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-5850:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5849:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5842:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5840:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5830:\n\tThe class loader did not properly check the package access for non-public proxy classes. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nCVE-2013-5829:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5825:\n\tMultiple errors were discovered in the way the JAXP and Security components processes XML inputs. A remote attacker could create a crafted XML that would cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory when processed.\n\nCVE-2013-5823:\n\tMultiple errors were discovered in the way the JAXP and Security components processes XML inputs. A remote attacker could create a crafted XML that would cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory when processed.\n\nCVE-2013-5820:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5817:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5814:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5809:\n\tMultiple input checking flaws were discovered in the JPEG image reading and writing code in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5804:\n\tMultiple input sanitization flaws were discovered in javadoc. When javadoc documentation was generated from an untrusted Java source code and hosted on a domain not controlled by the code author, these issues could make it easier to perform cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nCVE-2013-5803:\n\tThe Kerberos implementation in OpenJDK did not properly parse KDC responses. A malformed packet could cause a Java application using JGSS to exit.\n\nCVE-2013-5802:\n\tThe FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING setting was not properly honored by the javax.xml.transform package transformers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to supply a crafted XML that would be processed without the intended security restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5797:\n\tMultiple input sanitization flaws were discovered in javadoc. When javadoc documentation was generated from an untrusted Java source code and hosted on a domain not controlled by the code author, these issues could make it easier to perform cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nCVE-2013-5790:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5784:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5783:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5782:\n\tMultiple input checking flaws were found in the 2D component native image parsing code. A specially crafted image file could trigger a Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nCVE-2013-5780:\n\tVarious OpenJDK classes that represent cryptographic keys could leak private key information by including sensitive data in strings returned by toString() methods. These flaws could possibly lead to an unexpected exposure of sensitive key data.\n\nCVE-2013-5778:\n\tIt was discovered that the 2D component image library did not properly check bounds when performing image conversions. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the Java Virtual Machine memory.\n\nCVE-2013-5774:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-5772:\n\tThe Java Heap Analysis Tool (jhat) failed to properly escape all data added into the HTML pages it generated. Crafted content in the memory of a Java program analyzed using jhat could possibly be used to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nCVE-2013-4002:\n\tMultiple errors were discovered in the way the JAXP and Security components processes XML inputs. A remote attacker could create a crafted XML that would cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory when processed.\n\nCVE-2013-3829:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries, Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n",
