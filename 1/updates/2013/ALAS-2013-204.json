	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-2473:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2472:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2471:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2470:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2469:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2465:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2463:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2461:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component contained certain errors related to XML security and the class loader. A remote attacker could possibly exploit these flaws to bypass intended security mechanisms or disclose potentially sensitive information and cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2013-2460:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2459:\n\tInteger overflow flaws were found in the way AWT processed certain input. An attacker could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an untrusted Java applet or application.\n\nCVE-2013-2458:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2457:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2456:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2455:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2454:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2453:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2452:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2450:\n\tIt was discovered that the AWT component did not properly manage certain resources and that the ObjectStreamClass of the Serialization component did not properly handle circular references. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2013-2449:\n\tIt was discovered that GnomeFileTypeDetector did not check for read permissions when accessing files. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2448:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound, JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2447:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2446:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2445:\n\tIt was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle out-of-memory errors. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to terminate the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nCVE-2013-2444:\n\tIt was discovered that the AWT component did not properly manage certain resources and that the ObjectStreamClass of the Serialization component did not properly handle circular references. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2013-2443:\n\tMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2412:\n\tIt was discovered that JConsole did not properly inform the user when establishing an SSL connection failed. An attacker could exploit this flaw to gain access to potentially sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2013-2407:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component contained certain errors related to XML security and the class loader. A remote attacker could possibly exploit these flaws to bypass intended security mechanisms or disclose potentially sensitive information and cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2013-1571:\n\tIt was found that documentation generated by Javadoc was vulnerable to a frame injection attack. If such documentation was accessible over a network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web content being displayed next to the documentation. This could be used to perform a phishing attack by providing frame content that spoofed a login form on the site hosting the vulnerable documentation.\n\nCVE-2013-1500:\n\tIt was discovered that the 2D component created shared memory segments with insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to read or write to the shared memory segment.\n",
