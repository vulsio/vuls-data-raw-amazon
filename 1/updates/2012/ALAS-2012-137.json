  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-5086:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, and 6 Update 35 and earlier, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Beans.\nMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Swing, and JMX components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\nMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Libraries, Swing, and JMX components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n865428: \nCVE-2012-5086 OpenJDK: XMLDecoder sandbox restriction bypass (Beans, 7195917)\n\nCVE-2012-5085:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, 5.0 Update 36 and earlier, and 1.4.2_38 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors related to Networking.  NOTE: the Oracle CPU states that this issue has a 0.0 CVSS score. If so, then this is not a vulnerability and this issue should not be included in CVE.\nThis update disables Gopher protocol support in the java.net package by default. Gopher support can be enabled by setting the newly introduced property, \"jdk.net.registerGopherProtocol\", to true.\n865541: \nCVE-2012-5085 OpenJDK: disable Gopher support by default (Gopher, 7189567)\n\nCVE-2012-5081:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, 5.0 Update 36 and earlier, and 1.4.2_38 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect availability, related to JSSE.\nIt was discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS implementation did not properly handle handshake records containing an overly large data length value. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause an SSL/TLS server to terminate with an exception.\n865370: \nCVE-2012-5081 OpenJDK: JSSE denial of service (JSSE, 7186286)\n\nCVE-2012-5079:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, 5.0 Update 36 and earlier, and 1.4.2_38 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors related to Libraries.\nIt was discovered that java.util.ServiceLoader could create an instance of an incompatible class while performing provider lookup. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n865568: \nCVE-2012-5079 OpenJDK: ServiceLoader reject not subtype classes without instantiating (Libraries, 7195919)\n\nCVE-2012-5077:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, 5.0 Update 36 and earlier, and 1.4.2_38 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Security.\nIt was discovered that the SecureRandom class did not properly protect against the creation of multiple seeders. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose sensitive information.\n865354: \nCVE-2012-5077 OpenJDK: SecureRandom mulitple seeders information disclosure (Security, 7167656)\n\nCVE-2012-5075:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 36 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, related to JMX.\nIt was discovered that the JMX component in OpenJDK could perform certain actions in an insecure manner. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose sensitive information.\n865363: \nCVE-2012-5075 OpenJDK: RMIConnectionImpl information disclosure (JMX, 7169888)\n\nCVE-2012-5068:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, and 6 Update 35 and earlier, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Libraries.\nMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Scripting, JMX, Concurrency, Libraries, and Security components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n865348: \nCVE-2012-5068 OpenJDK: RhinoScriptEngine security bypass (Scripting, 7143535)\n\nCVE-2012-4416:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, and 6 Update 35 and earlier, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors related to Hotspot.\nA bug in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine optimization code could cause it to not perform array initialization in certain cases. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the virtual machine's memory.\n856124: \nCVE-2012-4416 OpenJDK: uninitialized Array JVM memory disclosure (Hotspot, 7198606)\n\nCVE-2012-3216:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 7 and earlier, 6 Update 35 and earlier, 5.0 Update 36 and earlier, and 1.4.2_38 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Libraries.\nIt was discovered that the java.io.FilePermission class exposed the hash code of the canonicalized path name. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to determine certain system paths, such as the current working directory.\n865346: \nCVE-2012-3216 OpenJDK: java.io.FilePermission information leak (Libraries, 6631398)\n",
