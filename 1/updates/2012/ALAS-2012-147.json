	"Issued": {

	"Updated": {
		"Date": "2014-09-14 17:20:00"
	},
	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-5581:\n\tStack-based buffer overflow in tif_dir.c in LibTIFF before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DOTRANGE tag in a TIFF image.\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff handled DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n867235: \nCVE-2012-5581 libtiff: Stack-based buffer overflow when reading a tiled tiff file\n\nCVE-2012-4564:\n\tppm2tiff does not check the return value of the TIFFScanlineSize function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPM image that triggers an integer overflow, a zero-memory allocation, and a heap-based buffer overflow.\nA missing return value check flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the ppm2tiff tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted PPM (Portable Pixel Map) file that would cause ppm2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n871700: \nCVE-2012-4564 libtiff: Missing return value check in ppm2tiff leading to heap-buffer overflow when reading a tiff file\n\nCVE-2012-4447:\n\tHeap-based buffer overflow in tif_pixarlog.c in LibTIFF before 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image using the PixarLog Compression format.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff processed certain TIFF images using the Pixar Log Format encoding. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n860198: \nCVE-2012-4447 libtiff: Heap-buffer overflow when processing a TIFF image with PixarLog Compression\n\nCVE-2012-3401:\n\tThe t2p_read_tiff_init function in tiff2pdf (tools/tiff2pdf.c) in LibTIFF 4.0.2 and earlier does not properly initialize the T2P context struct pointer in certain error conditions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n837577: \nCVE-2012-3401 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper initialization of T2P context struct pointer\n",
