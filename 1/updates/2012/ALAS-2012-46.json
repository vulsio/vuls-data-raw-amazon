	},
	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-0053:\n\tprotocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.\nThe httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header. Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies.\n\nCVE-2012-0031:\n\tscoreboard.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.21 and earlier might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash during shutdown) or possibly have unspecified other impact by modifying a certain type field within a scoreboard shared memory segment, leading to an invalid call to the free function.\nA flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information. A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to crash during httpd service shutdown.\n\nCVE-2011-3639:\n\tThe mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x before 2.2.18, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers by using the HTTP/0.9 protocol with a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.\nIt was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-3368 (released via RHSA-2011:1392) did not completely address the problem. An attacker could bypass the fix and make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not directly accessible to the attacker by sending an HTTP version 0.9 request.\nIt was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-3368 (released via RHSA-2011:1391) did not completely address the problem. An attacker could bypass the fix and make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not directly accessible to the attacker by sending an HTTP version 0.9 request, or by using a specially-crafted URI.\n\nCVE-2011-3607:\n\tInteger overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a \".htaccess\" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the \"apache\" user.\n",
