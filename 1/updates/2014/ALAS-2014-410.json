	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-3577:\n\tIt was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate.\n1129074: \nCVE-2014-3577 Apache HttpComponents client: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-6153 fix\n\nCVE-2012-6153:\n\tIt was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate.\n1129916: \nCVE-2012-6153 Apache HttpComponents client: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-5783 fix\n\nCVE-2012-5783:\n\tThe Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name.\nApache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.\n873317: \nCVE-2012-5783 jakarta-commons-httpclient: missing connection hostname check against X.509 certificate name\n",
