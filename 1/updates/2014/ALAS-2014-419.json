	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-7187:\n\tAn off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not otherwise be executed by Bash.\n1146804: \nCVE-2014-7187 bash: off-by-one error in deeply nested flow control constructs\n\nCVE-2014-7186:\n\tIt was discovered that the fixed-sized redir_stack could be forced to overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that would not otherwise be run as code.\n1146791: \nCVE-2014-7186 bash: parser can allow out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack\n\nCVE-2014-7169:\n\tGNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.\nDetails pending\n1146319: \nCVE-2014-7169 bash: code execution via specially-crafted environment (Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271)\n1146319: \nCVE-2014-7169 bash: Code execution via specially-crafted environment (Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271)\n",
