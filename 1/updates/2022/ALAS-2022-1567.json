	"Title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2022-1567: medium priority package update for vim",
	"Issued": {
		"Date": "2022-02-17 18:34"

	"Updated": {
		"Date": "2024-02-14 20:03"

	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-0359:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access with large tabstop in Ex mode, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0351:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to too many recursions, which can lead to a segmentation fault. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0318:\n\tA flaw was found in vim.  The vulnerability occurs due to reading beyond the end of a line in the utf_head_off function, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0261:\n\tA heap based out-of-bounds write flaw was found in vim's ops.c. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user to open a crafted file triggering an out-of-bounds write. This vulnerability is capable of crashing software, modify memory, and possible code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0213:\n\tA flaw was found in vim.  The vulnerability occurs due to not checking the length for the NameBuff function, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0158:\n\tIt was found that vim was vulnerable to a 1 byte heap based out of bounds read flaw in the `compile_get_env()` function. A file could use that flaw to disclose 1 byte of vim's internal memory.\n\nCVE-2022-0156:\n\tIt was found that vim was vulnerable to use-after-free flaw in the way it was treating allocated lines in user functions. A specially crafted file could crash the vim process or possibly lead to other undefined behaviors.\n\nCVE-2021-3875:\n\tThere's an out-of-bounds read flaw in Vim's ex_docmd.c. An attacker who is capable of tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file could trigger an out-of-bounds read on a memmove operation, potentially causing an impact to application availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3872:\n\tAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in vim's drawscreen.c win_redr_status() function. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user to open a crafted file with specific arguments in vim, triggering an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3778:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. A possible heap-based buffer overflow could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to a crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n",
