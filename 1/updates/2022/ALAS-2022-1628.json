This issue occurs due to invalid memory access when using an expression on the command line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2129:\n\tOut-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-2126:\n\tOut-of-bounds Read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-2125:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-2124:\n\tBuffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-2042:\n\tA heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's skipwhite() function of the src/charset.c file. This flaw occurs because of an uninitialized attribute value and freed memory in the spell command. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2000:\n\tAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in Vim's append_command() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. This issue occurs when an error for a command goes over the end of IObuff. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory.\n\nCVE-2022-1968:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a use-after-free vulnerability in the utf_ptr2char function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1942:\n\tAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in Vim's vim_regsub_both() function in the src/regexp.c file. The flaw can open a command-line window from a substitute expression when a text or buffer is locked. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds write that causes an application to crash, possibly reading and modifying some amount of memory contents.\n\nCVE-2022-1927:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a buffer over-read vulnerability in the utf_ptr2char function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1898:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a use-after-free vulnerability in the find_pattern_in_path function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1897:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the vim_regsub_both function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1886:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Vim's utf_head_off() function in the mbyte.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service and possibly some amount of memory leak.\n\nCVE-2022-1851:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the gchar_cursor function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1796:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a use after free vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1785:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the ex_cmds function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1771:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-1769:\n\tBuffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4974.\n\nCVE-2022-1735:\n\tClassic Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4969.\n\nCVE-2022-1733:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4968.\n\nCVE-2022-1725:\n\tNULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.495\n\nCVE-2022-1720:\n\tA heap buffer over-read vulnerability was found in Vim's grab_file_name() function of the src/findfile.c file. This flaw occurs because the function reads after the NULL terminates the line with \"gf\" in Visual block mode. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer over-read vulnerability that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory.\n\nCVE-2022-1674:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's vim_regexec_string() function in regexp.c file. The issue occurs when the function tries to match the buffer with an invalid pattern. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1629:\n\tBuffer Over-read in function find_next_quote in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4925. This vulnerabilities are capable of crashing software, Modify Memory, and possible remote execution\n\nCVE-2022-1621:\n\tHeap buffer overflow in vim_strncpy find_word in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4919. This vulnerability is capable of crashing software, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Modify Memory, and possible remote execution\n\nCVE-2022-1620:\n\tNULL Pointer Dereference in function vim_regexec_string at regexp.c:2729 in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4901. NULL Pointer Dereference in function vim_regexec_string at regexp.c:2729 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted input.\n\nCVE-2022-1619:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in function cmdline_erase_chars in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4899. This vulnerabilities are capable of crashing software, modify memory, and possible remote execution\n\nCVE-2022-1616:\n\tUse after free in append_command in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4895. This vulnerability is capable of crashing software, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Modify Memory, and possible remote execution\n",
