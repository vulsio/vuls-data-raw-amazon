	"Title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2022-1591: important priority package update for kernel",
	"Issued": {
		"Date": "2022-05-31 23:47:00"
	},
	"Updated": {
		"Date": "2024-06-07 05:16:00"
	},
	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-4459:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup.\n\nCVE-2023-4387:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in VMware's vmxnet3 ethernet NIC driver in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a double-free while cleaning up vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all, which could also lead to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-1637:\n\tA flaw that boot CPU could be vulnerable for the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks in the Linux kernel X86 CPU Power management options functionality was found in the way user resuming CPU from suspend-to-RAM. A local user could use this flaw to potentially get unauthorized access to some memory of the CPU similar to the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-41858:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A NULL pointer dereference may occur while a slip driver is in progress to detach in sl_tx_timeout in drivers/net/slip/slip.c. This issue could allow an attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2022-30594:\n\tThe Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.\n\nCVE-2022-2977:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel implementation of proxied virtualized TPM devices. On a system where virtualized TPM devices are configured (this is not the default) a local attacker can create a use-after-free and create a situation where it may be possible to escalate privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-29581:\n\tImproper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions.\n\nCVE-2022-28390:\n\tA double-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ems_usb_start_xmit function. This flaw allows an attacker to create a memory leak and corrupt the underlying data structure by calling free more than once.\n\nCVE-2022-28389:\n\tmcba_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free.\n\nCVE-2022-2639:\n\tAn integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-1729:\n\tperf: Fix sys_perf_event_open() race against self\n\nCVE-2022-1516:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-1353:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2022-1011:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write(). This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2022-0854:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n",
