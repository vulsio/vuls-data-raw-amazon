	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-8103:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8102:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8101:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8100:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8099:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8098:\n\tMultiple integer overflow flaws and out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain X11 core protocol and GLX extension requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\n\nCVE-2014-8097:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server, or leak memory contents to the client.\n\nCVE-2014-8096:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8095:\n\tMultiple out-of-bounds access flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8094:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain DRI2 extension requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use this flaw to crash the X.Org server.\n\nCVE-2014-8093:\n\tMultiple integer overflow flaws and out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain X11 core protocol and GLX extension requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\n\nCVE-2014-8092:\n\tMultiple integer overflow flaws and out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain X11 core protocol and GLX extension requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\n\nCVE-2014-8091:\n\tIt was found that the X.Org server did not properly handle SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC) authentication credentials. A malicious, unauthenticated client could use this flaw to crash the X.Org server by submitting a specially crafted authentication request.\n",
