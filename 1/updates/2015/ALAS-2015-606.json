  "Updated": {
    "Date": "2015-10-27 16:51"

  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2015-4911:\n\tMultiple denial of service flaws were found in the JAXP component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted XML file could cause a Java application using JAXP to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory when parsed.\n\nCVE-2015-4903:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4893:\n\tMultiple denial of service flaws were found in the JAXP component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted XML file could cause a Java application using JAXP to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory when parsed.\n\nCVE-2015-4883:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4882:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4881:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4872:\n\tIt was discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK failed to properly check if a certificate satisfied all defined constraints. In certain cases, this could cause a Java application to accept an X.509 certificate which does not meet requirements of the defined policy.\n\nCVE-2015-4868:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the Libraries component in OpenJDK handled certificate revocation lists (CRL). In certain cases, CRL checking code could fail to report a revoked certificate, causing the application to accept it as trusted.\n\nCVE-2015-4860:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4844:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4843:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4842:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4840:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4835:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4806:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4805:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization, and 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2015-4803:\n\tMultiple denial of service flaws were found in the JAXP component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted XML file could cause a Java application using JAXP to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory when parsed.\n\nCVE-2015-4734:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n",
