  "Title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2015-550: medium priority package update for openssl",
  "Issued": {

  "Updated": {

  "Severity": "medium",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2015-4000:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the TLS protocol composes the Diffie-Hellman exchange (for both export and non-export grade cipher suites). An attacker could use this flaw to downgrade a DHE connection to use export-grade key sizes, which could then be broken by sufficient pre-computation. This can lead to a passive man-in-the-middle attack in which the attacker is able to decrypt all traffic.\n1223211: \nCVE-2015-4000 LOGJAM: TLS connections which support export grade DHE key-exchange are vulnerable to MITM attacks\n\nCVE-2015-3216:\n\tA regression was found in the versions of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, in the ssleay_rand_bytes() function. This could lead a multi-threaded application to crash.\n1227574: \nCVE-2015-3216 openssl: Crash in ssleay_rand_bytes due to locking regression\n\nCVE-2015-1792:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL in the way it verified certain signed messages using CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax). A remote attacker could cause an application using OpenSSL to use excessive amounts of memory by sending a specially-crafted message for verification.\n1228607: \nCVE-2015-1792 OpenSSL: CMS verify infinite loop with unknown hash function\n\nCVE-2015-1791:\n\tA race condition was found in the session handling code of OpenSSL. An attacker could cause a multi-threaded SSL/TLS server to crash.\n1228608: \nCVE-2015-1791 OpenSSL: Race condition handling NewSessionTicket\n\nCVE-2015-1790:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not affected by this flaw.\n1228604: \nCVE-2015-1790 OpenSSL: PKCS7 crash with missing EnvelopedContent\n\nCVE-2015-1789:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could possibly use a specially-crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would cause that application to crash.\n1228603: \nCVE-2015-1789 OpenSSL: out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time\n\nCVE-2014-8176:\n\tAn invalid-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS handshake messages. A malicious DTLS client or server could send a specially-crafted message to the peer, which could cause the application to crash or potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n1228611: \nCVE-2014-8176 OpenSSL: Invalid free in DTLS\n",
