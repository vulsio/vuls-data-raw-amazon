	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-1983:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator. Specifically, this flaw occurs in the ip_reass() routine while reassembling incoming IP fragments whose combined size is bigger than 65k. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.\nA use after free vulnerability in ip_reass() in ip_input.c of libslirp 4.2.0 and prior releases allows crafted packets to cause a denial of service.\n1829825: CVE-2020-1983 QEMU: slirp: use-after-free in ip_reass() function in ip_input.c\n\nCVE-2020-14364:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.\n1869201: CVE-2020-14364 QEMU: usb: out-of-bounds r/w access issue while processing usb packets\n\nCVE-2019-14378:\n\tip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment.\nA heap buffer overflow issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs in the ip_reass() routine while reassembling incoming packets if the first fragment is bigger than the m->m_dat[] buffer. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a Denial of Service or potentially executing arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.\n1734745: CVE-2019-14378 QEMU: slirp: heap buffer overflow during packet reassembly\n\nCVE-2018-15746:\n\tqemu-seccomp.c in QEMU might allow local OS guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) by leveraging mishandling of the seccomp policy for threads other than the main thread.\n1615637: CVE-2018-15746 QEMU: seccomp: blacklist is not applied to all threads\n",
