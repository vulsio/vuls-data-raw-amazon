  "Title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2020-1369: important priority package update for bind",

  "Updated": {

  "Severity": "important",
  "Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-8617:\n\tUsing a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.\nAn assertion failure was found in BIND, which checks the validity of messages containing TSIG resource records. This flaw allows an attacker that knows or successfully guesses the name of the TSIG key used by the server to use a specially-crafted message, potentially causing a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state or cause a denial of service. A majority of BIND servers have an internally-generated TSIG session key whose name is trivially guessable, and that key exposes the vulnerability unless specifically disabled.\n1836124: CVE-2020-8617 bind: A logic error in code which checks TSIG validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure in tsig.c\n\nCVE-2020-8616:\n\tA malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.\nA flaw was found in BIND, where it does not sufficiently limit the number of fetches that can be performed while processing a referral response. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The attacker can also exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.\n1836118: CVE-2020-8616 bind: BIND does not sufficiently limit the number of fetches performed when processing referrals\n",
