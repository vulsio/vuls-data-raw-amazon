	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-13509:\n\tIn Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-13509 docker: Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log leading to information disclosure\n\nCVE-2019-13139:\n\tA command injection flaw was discovered in Docker during the `docker build` command. By providing a specially crafted path argument for the container to build, it is possible to inject command options to the `git fetch`/`git checkout` commands that are executed by Docker and to execute code with the privileges of the user running Docker. A local attacker who can run `docker build` with a controlled build path, or a remote attacker who has control over the docker build path, could elevate their privileges or execute code.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-13139 docker: command injection due to a missing validation of the git ref command\n",
