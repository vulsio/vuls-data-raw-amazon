	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-3191:\n\t* A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS share mounted.\n* A malicious CIFS (Common Internet File System) server could send a specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS share mounted.\n\nCVE-2011-3188:\n\t* The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were generated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are now more random.\n* IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence number and fragment ID generation could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence number and fragment IDs are now more random.\n\nCVE-2011-2918:\n\t* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Performance Events implementation handled PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK counter overflow. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-2723:\n\tThe skb_gro_header_slow function in include/linux/netdevice.h in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39.4, when Generic Receive Offload (GRO) is enabled, resets certain fields in incorrect situations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted network traffic.\n* GRO (Generic Receive Offload) fields could be left in an inconsistent state. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. GRO is enabled by default in all network drivers that support it.\n* A flaw in skb_gro_header_slow() in the Linux kernel could lead to GRO (Generic Receive Offload) fields being left in an inconsistent state. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service. GRO is enabled by default in all network drivers that support it.\n\nCVE-2011-1833:\n\tA race condition flaw was found in the way mount.ecryptfs_private checked the permissions of the directory to mount. A local attacker could use this flaw to mount (and then access) a directory they would otherwise not have access to. Note: The fix for this issue is incomplete until a kernel-space change is made. Future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 kernel updates will correct this issue.\n* A race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eCryptfs implementation. A local attacker could use the mount.ecryptfs_private utility to mount (and then access) a directory they would otherwise not have access to. Note: To correct this issue, the RHSA-2011:1241 ecryptfs-utils update, which provides the user-space part of the fix, must also be installed.\n* A local attacker could use mount.ecryptfs_private to mount (and then access) a directory they would otherwise not have access to. Note: To correct this issue, the RHSA-2011:1241 ecryptfs-utils update must also be installed.\n",
