	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-7396:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled client connections. A remote unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly send connection requests to the Xvnc server, causing it to consume large amounts of memory resources over time, and ultimately leading to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.\n1438703: \nCVE-2017-7396 tigervnc: SecurityServer and ClientServer memory leaks\n\nCVE-2017-7395:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled ClientCutText messages. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by sending specially crafted ClientCutText messages, resulting in denial of service.\n1438701: \nCVE-2017-7395 tigervnc: Integer overflow in SMsgReader::readClientCutText\n\nCVE-2017-7394:\n\tA missing input sanitization flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled credentials. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by sending specially crafted usernames, resulting in denial of service.\n1438700: \nCVE-2017-7394 tigervnc: Server crash via long usernames\n\nCVE-2017-7393:\n\tA double free flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled ClientFence messages. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by sending specially crafted ClientFence messages, resulting in denial of service.\n1438697: \nCVE-2017-7393 tigervnc: Double free via crafted fences\n\nCVE-2017-7392:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled termination of VeNCrypt connections. A remote unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly send connection requests to the Xvnc server, causing it to consume large amounts of memory resources over time, and ultimately leading to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.\n1438694: \nCVE-2017-7392 tigervnc: SSecurityVeNCrypt memory leak\n\nCVE-2017-5581:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw, leading to memory corruption, was found in TigerVNC viewer. A remote malicious VNC server could use this flaw to crash the client vncviewer process resulting in denial of service.\n1415712: \nCVE-2017-5581 tigervnc: Buffer overflow in ModifiablePixelBuffer::fillRect\n\nCVE-2016-10207:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in the TigerVNC&#039;s Xvnc server. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by terminating the TLS handshake process early.\n1418761: \nCVE-2016-10207 tigervnc: VNC server can crash when TLS handshake terminates early\n",
