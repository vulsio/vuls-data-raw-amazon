	"Severity": "medium",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2016-9675:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the patch for CVE-2013-6045 for OpenJPEG. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image, when read by an application using OpenJPEG, could cause heap-based buffer overflows leading to a crash or possible code execution.\n1382202: \nCVE-2016-9675 openjpeg: incorrect fix for CVE-2013-6045\n\nCVE-2016-7163:\n\tAn integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was found in OpenJPEG. An attacker could create a crafted JPEG2000 image that, when loaded by an application using openjpeg, could lead to a crash or, potentially, code execution.\n1374329: \nCVE-2016-7163 openjpeg: Integer overflow in opj_pi_create_decode\n\nCVE-2016-5159:\n\tAn integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was found in openjpeg, also affecting the PDF viewer in Chromium. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image could cause an incorrect calculation when allocating memory for code blocks, which could lead to a crash, or potentially, code execution.\n1372220: \nCVE-2016-5159 chromium-browser, openjpeg: heap overflow in parsing of JPEG2000 code blocks\n\nCVE-2016-5158:\n\tAn integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was found in openjpeg, also affecting the PDF viewer in Chromium. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image could cause incorrect calculations when allocating various data structures, which could lead to a crash, or potentially, code execution.\n1372219: \nCVE-2016-5158 chromium-browser, openjpeg: heap overflow due to unsafe use of opj_aligned_malloc\n\nCVE-2016-5139:\n\tAn integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was found in openjpeg, also affecting the PDF viewer in Chromium. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image could cause an incorrect calculation when allocating precinct data structures, which could lead to a crash, or potentially, code execution.\n1363982: \nCVE-2016-5139 chromium-browser, openjpeg: Heap overflow in parsing of JPEG2000 precincts\n",
