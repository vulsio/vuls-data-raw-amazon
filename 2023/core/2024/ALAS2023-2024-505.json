It was discovered that information is still included in the output in certain tasks, such as loop items. Depending on the task, this issue may include sensitive information, such as decrypted secret values.\n\nCVE-2023-5115:\n\tThe upstream report describes this issue as follows:\n\nWhen installing a maliciously created Ansible role using 'ansible-galaxy role install', arbitrary files the user has access to can be overwritten. The malicious role must contain a symlink with an absolute path to the target file, followed by a file of the same name (as the symlink) with the contents to write to the target.\n",
