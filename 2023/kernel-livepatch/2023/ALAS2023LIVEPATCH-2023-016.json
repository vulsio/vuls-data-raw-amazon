	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 - Kernel Livepatch that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-35788:\n\tAn issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-3090:\n\tA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb->cb  initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled.\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.\n\nCVE-2023-2156:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem within the RPL protocol's handling. This issue results from the improper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system.\n",
