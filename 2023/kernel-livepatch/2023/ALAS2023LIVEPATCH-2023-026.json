	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 - Kernel Livepatch that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-5717:\n\tA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nIf perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.\n\nCVE-2023-5197:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nAddition and removal of rules from chain bindings within the same transaction causes leads to use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit f15f29fd4779be8a418b66e9d52979bb6d6c2325.\n\nCVE-2023-5090:\n\tx86: KVM: SVM: always update the x2avic msr interception\n\nCVE-2023-4921:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue().\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.\n\nCVE-2023-4623:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nIf a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-45871:\n\tAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.\n\nCVE-2023-42752:\n\tAn integer overflow in kmalloc_reserve() in the Linux kernel may allow a local user to crash the system, or in some cases obtain code execution in kernel space.\n",
