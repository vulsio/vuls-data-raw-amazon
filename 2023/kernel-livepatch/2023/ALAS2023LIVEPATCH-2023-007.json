	"Severity": "important",
	"Description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 - Kernel Livepatch that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-32233:\n\tIn the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled.\n\nCVE-2023-2124:\n\tAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFS file system in how a user restores an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-48425:\n\tIn the Linux kernel through 6.2.7, fs/ntfs3/inode.c has an invalid kfree because it does not validate MFT flags before replaying logs.\n",
